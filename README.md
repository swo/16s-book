# 16S Primer

This is an informal introduction to the theory of 16S data processing. I
compiled these after giving a few workshops on this topic, mostly to the Alm
Lab at MIT.

This is the same content as was published on
[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/primer16s).

## To do

- Finish final section
- Clean up formatting for Pandoc (not Leanpub) style Markdown
- Update references (e.g., Qiime 2, DADA 2, etc.)
- Update README
